## What I learned

Through this React course project, I delved into a variety of crucial concepts
and techniques. Firstly, I honed my proficiency in handling forms in React,
understanding how to efficiently manage user inputs and handle form submissions.

Additionally, I gained a deep understanding of the `useEffect()` hook, which
allowed me to perform side effects in my components. I specifically learned how
to properly clean up event listeners within the `useEffect()` hook, preventing
memory leaks in my application.

One of the highlights of this project was learning how to fetch data from APIs
in React, leveraging the power of `useEffect()` to efficiently make asynchronous
requests.

Lastly, I tackled more complex state management scenarios involving arrays and
objects using `useState()`. Overall, this course project provided me with a
comprehensive toolkit for developing robust and feature-rich React applications,
and I feel confident in my ability to tackle a wide range of projects in the
future.
